   <p> as the internet grows, it's best to stay safe online by incoorporating a complicated password
    in order to avoid your accounts getting hacked into.</p>

---
    1. password length:

   <p>- the easiest way of keeping your password unbreakable is by making your password <strong>loooooooooooooong.</strong>
   <p>- keeping passwords <strong>long but not complicated</strong> makes it easy for you to remember your password.</p>
   <p>- according to microsoft, the <strong>recommended length of a password should be at least 8 characters!</strong></p>

---
    2. reusing a password
   <p>- one of the <strong>most common ways</strong> people get their accounts stolen.</p>
   <p>- if your password is leaked in a <strong><i>data breach</strong></i> for example, hackers will try and use it on other popular websites or services (like your bank).</p>
   <p>- instead, you should <strong><u>use a unique password for any website you sign up to,</strong></u> to avoid any risks!</p>

---
    3. complexity
   <p>- sometimes, letters and numbers still aren't enough to keep your account secure.</p>
   <p>- to make a password more complicated, you can add symbols, such as <strong>$, !, ?, and - .</strong></p>

 ---
    4. personal information
   <p>- is the only way you remember a password by your name, or birthday, or address?</p>
   <p>- <strong><u>that is a general security hazard,</strong></u> as if a hacker finds your password, they also can find out your personal information</p>
   <p>- instead, <strong>try creating a password</strong> that is unrelated to you or anyone you know!</p>
  
  ---
    5. check/update your passwords
   <p>- you should <strong><u>routinely check your password for data breaches</strong></u></p>
   <p>- you should also <strong>update your password regularly</strong>, especially for important accounts</p>
   <p>- you should also <strong>enable 2FA/MFA</strong> if you can!</p>
