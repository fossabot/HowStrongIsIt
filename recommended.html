  <h1> general password practises!</h1>

   <p> as the internet grows, it's best to stay safe online by incoorporating a complicated password
    in order to avoid your accounts getting hacked into.</p>

    <h2>1. password length:</h2>

   <p>- the easiest way of keeping your password unbreakable is by making your password loooooooooooooong.</p>
   <p>- keeping passwords long but not complicated makes it easy for you to remember your password.</p>
   <p>- according to microsoft, the recommended length of a password should be 8 characters!</p>

   <h2>2. reusing a password</h2>
   <p>- one of the most common ways people get their accounts stolen.</p>
   <p>- if your password is leaked in a data breach for example, hackers will try and use it on other popular websites or services (like your bank).</p>
   <p>- instead, you should use a unique password for any website you sign up to, to avoid any risks!</p>

   <h2>3. complexity</h2>
   <p>- sometimes, letters and numbers still aren't enough to keep your account secure.</p>
   <p>- to make a password more complicated, you can add symbols, such as $, !, ?, and - .</p>

   <h2>4. personal information</h2>
   <p>- is the only way you remember a password by your name, or birthday, or address.</p>
   <p>- that is a general security hazard, as if a hacker finds your password, they also find out your personal information</p>
   <p>- instead, try creating a password that is unrelated to you or anyone you know!</p>
  
   <h2>5. check/update your passwords</h2>
   <p>- you should routinely check your password for data breaches</p>
   <p>- you should also update your password regularly, especially for important accounts</p>
   <p>- you should also enable 2FA/MFA if you can!</p>
